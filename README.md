# Data-Science-projects
Repository for displaying my personal data science and machine learning projects

1. **Heart disease data**: In this folder there are two notebooks relating to a dataset retrieved from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci) of heart disease patients. The [first](https://github.com/collinb9/Data-Science-projects/blob/master/HeartDisease/Interpretation%20of%20data.ipynb) trains and interprets a logistic regression and random forest model to determine which variables are the best predictors of heart disease. The [second](https://github.com/collinb9/Data-Science-projects/blob/master/HeartDisease/Heart%20Disease.ipynb) goes through the process of training, selecting and optimising a model for classification.
