# Heart Disease Data

The two notebooks here are based on [this](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci) dataset of heart disease patients from kaggle. The interpretation of data notebook aims to investigate the most important risk factors of heart disease by interpreting a logistic regression and random forest model. We use permutation importance, Shapley values, dependency plots and the naive importance measures for these models. This SHAP summary plot gives a good measure of the importances.
